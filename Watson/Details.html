        Thomas J. Watson, Sr.Thomas J. Watson, Sr., in full Thomas John Watson, Sr., (born February 17, 1874, Campbell, New
        York, U.S.—died June 19, 1956, New York, New York), American industrialist who built the International Business
        Machines Corporation (IBM) into the largest manufacturer of electric typewriters and data-processing equipment in
        the world.

<p>
    The son of a lumber dealer, Watson studied at the Elmira (New York) School of Commerce and then worked as a
    salesman, first in a retail store and then for a small cash register company. In 1895 Watson joined the sales staff
    of the National Cash Register Company in Dayton, Ohio, and he eventually rose to the post of general sales manager
    of the company under the tutelage of its president, John Henry Patterson. In 1912 Patterson involved Watson in an
    illegal antitrust scheme that resulted in convictions for both men, later overturned. Watson left the National Cash
    Register in 1913.

<p>
    In 1914 Watson became president of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, a maker of electrical punch-card
    computing systems and other products; the company changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation in
    1924. An exceptional salesman and organizer, Watson assembled a highly motivated, well-trained, and well-paid staff.
    He gave pep talks, enforced a strict dress code, and posted the now famous slogan “Think” in company offices.
    Coupled with an aggressive research and development program, those efforts enabled IBM to dominate its market.
    Watson aggressively pursued international trade in the 1930s and ’40s, extending IBM’s virtual monopoly of the
    business machines industry worldwide. In 1952 he turned the IBM presidency over to his son, Thomas, Jr., while
    retaining the post of chairman. By the time of Watson’s death four years later, the company (which had 235 employees
    in 1914) employed 60,000 people and had 200 offices throughout the country, with factories and assembly plants
    around the world., in full Thomas John Watson, Sr., (born February 17, 1874, Campbell, New York, U.S.—died June 19,
